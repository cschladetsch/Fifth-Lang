# Executable Markdown
Markdown is useful. Wouldn't it be nice to be able to use it as actual source code for
writing programs?

## Motivation
Documenting code is hard, especially new code, and especially code for new languages. By using
code embedded in markdown text, we can have all the benefits of markdown and inject code into it.

```f
1 2 3 + + 6 dup print == assert # comment
1 print
```
