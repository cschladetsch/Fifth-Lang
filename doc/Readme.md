# The Fifth System
The *Fifth* system of languages and processes is designed around a core *Executor* which acts as a Vm (Virtual Machine).

## Pi
*Pi* is a Forth-like Rpn (Reverse Polish Notation) language, designed to be fast to parse and execute.
```pi
"TODO" print
```

## Rho
*Rho* is a python-like language that transpiles to *pi* code.
```rho
print("TODO");
```

## Tau
*Tau* is an Idl (Interface Definition Language). It is used to provide type-safe transport of object and continuations across the network. It is designed to replace REST-like systems.
```tau
class Foo {
    int Plus(int n);
}
```

## Future Work
Do it all.
